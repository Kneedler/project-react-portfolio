# React Portfolio
An Portfolio created in React with components and styled components, following a specific design. 

## The problem
Fetshing and using styled components. I realized that when styling you have to think about how you map, and if you style it, the style also repeats. 

If I had more time, I would change the way I use the social links, to be reusable. I would also add my article to My thoughts. The OG-tags are not working, so I'd also fix that. And overall optimizing my components and the style. I feel there is a lot that I could fix, and that I want to fix to make the code cleaner and easier to read.
